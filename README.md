# Smart Agriculture Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a smart agriculture system using IoT technology. The system employs sensors and actuators to monitor soil and weather conditions, automate irrigation, and display real-time data on the Blynk cloud platform. The aim is to enhance agricultural efficiency and conserve resources.

## Components Used
1. **ESP8266**: Microcontroller for Wi-Fi connectivity and control.
2. **Rain Sensor**: Detects rainfall to prevent over-irrigation.
3. **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Monitors soil moisture levels to optimize irrigation.
4. **Relay Module**: Controls the motor for automated irrigation.
5. **Buck Converter**: Converts power to the required levels for the ESP8266 and other components.
6. **Blynk Cloud**: Displays real-time data and allows remote monitoring and control.

## Features
- **Automated Irrigation**: Controls the motor based on soil moisture levels.
- **Rain Detection**: Stops irrigation during rainfall to conserve water.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays data such as soil moisture and rainfall status on the Blynk cloud.
- **Remote Control**: Enables farmers to control the irrigation system from a smartphone or web application.

## Software Requirements
1. **Arduino IDE**: For programming the ESP8266.
2. **Blynk Library**: For integrating with the Blynk cloud platform.
3. **Wi-Fi Network**: For real-time data transmission.

## Steps to Implement
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Assemble the components as per the circuit diagram.
   - Ensure proper power regulation using the buck converter.
2. **Blynk Configuration**:
   - Create a new project on the Blynk app and obtain the authentication token.
   - Add widgets for displaying sensor data and controlling the motor.
3. **Programming**:
   - Write code to:
     - Connect the ESP8266 to Wi-Fi.
     - Read data from the rain and soil moisture sensors.
     - Control the relay module for the motor.
     - Send real-time data to the Blynk cloud.
4. **Testing**:
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.
   - Test the system for accurate data reading, motor control, and real-time monitoring.
